# Blosm: The Universal Learning Environment

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/blosm-org/blosm-core.svg?branch=develop)](https://travis-ci.org/blosm-org/blosm-core)

Awesome! You made it to our GitHub page :cherry_blossom: :cherry_blossom:

Blosm is designed to be a universal hub of learning that crosses boundaries between institutes and experiences: a virtual environment for lifelong learning.

This document (the README file) is a hub to give you some information about the project. Jump straight to one of the sections below, or just scroll down to find out more.

## Mission

**Technologies we use have great impact on how we think and act**. One powerful type of technology is that of **Virtual Learning Environments**. These systems generally use lists to structure content, and seperate courses strictly. This invites passive consumption by students inside the virtual space, as the system is managed by the teacher and is otherwise static. Small modules such as forums have not solved this issue; it is the **structure itself that can use an upgrade**.

We aim to radically deviate from the design of other learning environments in order to give **control to the learner first and foremost**. All parts of offered content should be **remixable**, based on the actual learning journey of the individual student. This way, students can **contribute to courses as they are happening** rather than afterwards through evaluation forms.
We want to account for, help blossom and unite a radically pluriform and interconnected humanity.

This shift effectively makes Blosm a virtual learning environment that exists independently from schools and other educational providers, creating a **shared - but decentralised - infrastructure for all learners (read: all humans)** to connect and share.

## Feature Set

* **Unite your learning paths across platforms and contexts**  
  You will gain access to a personal garden where you can grow your learning journeys. Import learning paths from your formal schools and online learning providers, or create your own from scratch by collecting learning materials and putting them in order with an easy click-and-drag interface.
  
* **Share, (co-)create and remix learning paths**  
  Share learning content and paths with friends easily, or build them together in shared environments. Search published paths from the Blosm Network, remix them to suit your needs, and reshare them on the network.
  
* **Have a personal virtual learning environment tied to you, not an institution**  
  Hosted at your provider of choice, only you hold the keys to your data. Give permissions to join your journeys to those who you trust. Sharing with friends or classmates happens in decentralised manner.

### Use cases

* **Autonomous learners** who want to structure and document their process
* **Informal learning communities** who want to co-develop
* **Formal classroom teachers** who need a tool to both personalise learning and create a community inside their classroom, and share learning paths with colleagues and connect to parents outside of it
* **Educational designers** who want a universal platform to create and distribute their content
* **Corporate curriculum designers** who want to achieve a healthy professional-led learning culture
* **Learners with disabilities** who would benefit with a [Universal Design](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universal_design) approach for the platform and tagging system for its content
* **Improverished learners** in search for free tools to improve themselves, their locality and to display their informal learning process

Blosm's strength is that you can fit into multiple of these categories, and still they can all co-exist without the traditional boundaries between learning environments.

## How to contribute

Blosm is an **open source project** that encourages extensibility. We are looking for avid learners, inspiring educators and enthusiastic developers to help us shape the future of virtual educational spaces. Here are some active areas where you can currently jump in:

### Architecture ([contribute here](https://github.com/blosm-org/architecture-docs))
We need to account for the many types of educational standards already out there, and develop intuitive APIs for other developers to use the Blosm network. Back-end and front-end will be completely separated to allow multiple types of UIs to reach the same data, so the back-end definitions are our current concern.

### Experimental user interface design
We want to test multiple user interface designs to find out what is the most effective way to display learning journeys. Our goal is to make these age-neutral (no language, only icons) and suitable for both mobile and desktop. Connect with us to get our thoughts on it :smiley:

### Current Contributors
The founders of Blosm are many, and not all were able to join during the whole journey. The people you will see pass by most often in the development community, however, will likely be [Ivar](https://github.com/deSagaz) and [Andr√©](https://github.com/andretessmann).
